# **Game Rules**

Every new player starts with **300 points**. Each round, players can place bets on three different games: **D6, D8, and D10**.

## **D6 Game:**
Players bet on the outcome of rolling a six-sided die (**1–6**).<br>
If they guess correctly, their bet is multiplied by **x3**.

## **D8 Game:**
Players bet on the outcome of rolling an eight-sided die (**1–8**).<br>
If they guess correctly, their bet is multiplied by **x4**.

## **D10 Game:**
Players can bet on **1, 2, or 3 numbers** when rolling a ten-sided die (**1–10**).
- Each number requires a separate bet, and all bets in this game must be equal.
- The multiplier for a correct guess depends on how many numbers the player picks:
  - **1 number → x10**
  - **2 numbers → x5**
  - **3 numbers → x3**

The **first roll** in D10 determines a special **"wild" number**. This number applies to the **second roll** but does not grant any winnings on its own. If the **wild number** is chosen by the player and appears **again** on the second roll, their multiplier is **multiplied by x3**.

## **Bonus Multipliers for Correct Predictions:**
- If a player correctly predicts the results in **all three games (D6, D8, and D10) within a single week**, their **final score is multiplied by x3**.
- If a player correctly predicts the results in **two out of three games**, their **final score is multiplied by x2**.
(*These multipliers apply after any wild number calculations.*)

## **Betting Limit:**
- The **total sum of a player’s bets** cannot exceed the points of the player **with the lowest score**.
